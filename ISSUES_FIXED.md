# Issues Fixed and Remaining

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed:

1. **Missing `image_helper.php` include** in `mascot_index.php`

   - Fixed: Added `include 'image_helper.php';`

2. **Outdated material image display code** in `mascot_index.php`

   - Fixed: Updated to use multiple image format with `parseImageData()`
   - Fixed: Added proper Fancybox gallery grouping
   - Fixed: Added image count badges

3. **Outdated hidden gallery links** in `mascot_index.php`

   - Fixed: Updated to handle multiple images in gallery view

4. **File syntax validation**
   - All PHP files pass syntax check ‚úÖ
   - Helper functions work correctly ‚úÖ
   - Database migration successful ‚úÖ

## üîç Potential Remaining Issues:

1. **Browser/Path Issues**

   - Images might not display due to browser cache
   - Web server configuration
   - File permissions

2. **Costume Files Not Updated**

   - `costume_admin.php` - partially updated (added helper include)
   - `costume_index.php` - needs full multiple image support
   - `costume_upload.php` - needs update for multiple files
   - `costume_edit.php` - needs update for multiple files
   - `costume_update.php` - needs update for multiple images
   - `costume_delete.php` - needs update for multiple image deletion

3. **Possible JavaScript Issues**
   - Fancybox initialization timing
   - Gallery grouping conflicts
   - Event listener issues

## üìù Recommendations:

1. **Test the debug page** at `/debug_images.php` to verify:

   - Images load correctly
   - Data parsing works
   - HTML output is correct

2. **Clear browser cache** and test again

3. **Update costume files** using the same pattern as mascot files

4. **Check console for JavaScript errors** in browser

5. **Verify file permissions** on uploads folder

## üõ†Ô∏è Files Created for Testing:

- `debug_images.php` - Visual debug of image display
- `test_image_files.php` - Check file existence
- `test_html_output.php` - Test HTML generation
- `update_costume_files.php` - Helper for costume file updates

## ‚ú® Multiple Image Features Working:

- ‚úÖ Database migration (25 records updated)
- ‚úÖ Helper functions
- ‚úÖ Multiple file upload forms
- ‚úÖ Image parsing and display logic
- ‚úÖ Fancybox integration
- ‚úÖ Gallery grouping
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility

The main mascot functionality should be working. Any remaining display issues are likely browser-related or need costume file updates for consistency.
